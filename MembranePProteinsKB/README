The PHAT matrices are constructed from target values of a 
PHDhtm matrix and background frequencies of the Persson-Argos
matrix with corresponding entropy.

PHAT_T=75_B=73 indicates that target frequencies were obtained
from PHDhtm 75 and background frequencies from Persson-Argos 73. 

We found that PHAT_T=75_B73 worked best for transmembrane regions,
although all of the PHAT matrices showed significant improvement
over the generalized matrices BLOSUM62 and JTT-modified PAM and 
the JTT transmembrane matrix.
